In closest_wendys.py, I created a checkpoint in the program where after the closest Wendy's is calculated, the program checks with the user to ask if they would like to open Google maps. I made this change because it guarantees the user will be able to see the calculated distance that is printed out, and also some users may not want to open Google maps right away on their devices.
